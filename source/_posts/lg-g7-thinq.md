My favorite phone released this season doesn't have the speediest effectiveness, doesn't have the best camera, and has worse than average battery life. In addition, it has a superfluous press button for a via that I can't reprogram to something more valuable and gets the worst brand for a telephone I've observed in years. It's not really a phone that I would recommend most people can purchase. But LG's G7 ThinQ (I informed you it has the worst brand) is my favorite phone right now since it meets my particular set of wants and needs better than anything else at the moment.

The primary reason I love the G7 so substantially is that it's the Android phone that best mimics the iPhone X's capability to cram a huge screen in a frame that can still be managed in one hand. I love the iPhone X's design because it is optimized for how I use a phone, which contains a whole lot of vertical browsing while on the run. Tall, skinny phones will be the best because of this. But I don't actually like iOS, and I frequently crave Android's overall flexibility and interface.

## The G7 Mimics The iPhone X's Design and Aspect Ratio to Great Effect

LG aped the iPhone's notch and 19.5:9 aspect ratio, giving the G7 a similarly tall and skinny presence, but stretched the display sizes to a 6.1-inch diagonal, allowing for even more screen property. At the same time, the G7 measures just 2.8 inches across, which lets me reach across the screen very easily with my thumb when I'm using the phone in a single hand. It's narrower than any other Android phone with an iPhone X-like design I've used, including the OnePlus 6 or Huawei P20 Pro, yet includes a larger display compared to the Samsung S9 or iPhone X. The G7 does have even more of a "chin"(the bezel in the bottom) than the iPhone X, but that doesn't bother me, nor will the notch near the top of the display.

However the screen isn't the thing that retains me coming back to the G7. It includes a headphone jack, which doesn't matter to me for employ with headphones (I was on the cellular headphone train long before the headphone jack started going just how of the buffalo), but does matter a lot when I enter my wife's car and want to plug in to the auxiliary source and charge my telephone at the same time, without having to manage the car's awful Bluetooth set up.

It gets the loudest, clearest loudspeaker I've ever heard on a phone, which is ideal for when I'm viewing YouTube while sitting on my couch, something I do a great deal. It's not a stereo set up, like a great many other phones present, and it is feasible to block the loudspeaker with your hand in the event that you hold the phone wrong, but it's so loud therefore clear that those ideas don't bother me. LG's "Boombox" inner resonance chamber isn't only a marketing gimmick, it makes the whole machine pulsate when the quantity is cranked and creates the output also louder when the G7 is definitely resting on a desk.

The G7 also offers wireless charging, that i use each and every time I work from my table in the office and on my nightstand every evening. Wireless charging isn't as fast as wired charging, naturally, (and the LG doesn't possess Samsung's better, faster wireless charging) but it's extremely easy and, whenever I take advantage of a phone that lacks it, I miss to be able to simply drop my mobile on a charging pad or stand when I get to my desk. In addition, it allows me cope with the G7's admittedly bad battery lifestyle, which is far shorter than I could get with a great many other phones.

## A Good Headphone Jack, Loud Speaker, And Wireless Charging Are Must-Haves For Me

Like LG's V30, the G7 also offers the very best haptic vibration opinions obtainable in the Android environment. It's not quite as effective as Apple's Taptic Engine in the iPhone, but it's damn close, and puts every other Android mobile to shame. As my colleague Sam Byford features said, 'LG carries on to make phones that make it enjoyable to carry backspace to delete a whole lot of text'.

The G7 can be good enough in the departments of performance, software, and camera for my needs. I'd love for the video camera to be faster (it's one of the slowest modern cams I've employed) and I would certainly like for better battery lifestyle, but neither of those issues are so very bad that I'm compelled to give up the other things that the G7 brings to the desk. I've long hated LG's software style, but after years of refinements, the G7's interface has gotten to a point where it doesn't enter my way or switch my belly with poor aesthetics. Since it's Android, I'm likewise in a position to customize it extensively, even to the idea of taking the iPhone X's best-in-class gestural interface over to it.

I, of course, have other complaints with the G7, but those would connect with any phone I pick up on 2018. I'm paranoid that I'm going to scratch the display, so for the very first time ever before, I've put a display screen protector on my own phone. Before I purchased a G7 with my very own money, I applied our demo product from LG for two weeks and sure enough, I scratched the display screen in this time around. There are scratches on my iPhone X screen that I can't unsee and get me insane, therefore the G7 is certainly not exclusive in this respect.

I'm also extremely wary that LG will deliver computer software updates in a timely manner, despite its recent launch of a special software update initiative. History says the G7 will end up being forgotten and receive few, infrequent improvements on the program front. My Job Fi unit is running Android 8.0 with the June reliability patches, but who knows where it'll be a couple of months from now when Android 9.0 P officially drops.

Still, as We survey the field of phones released up to now this year and appearance forward to what's to arrive the trunk half, it's really difficult to see anything else meeting my needs much better than the G7 does right now. Google will surely have a fresh Pixel lineup this fall, nonetheless they most likely won't possess space useful designs or cellular charging, and they certainly won't possess a headphone jack. Samsung and LG both are anticipated to have new models out, nonetheless they will be larger phones, and Apple's up coming lineup of iPhones won't address any of my complaints with the current iPhone X.

All of that is to state, for my wants and necessities, LG's goofily named G7 ThinQ is the best phone released this season. Who'd have thunk it.
