I need to understand this out there prior to the brand-new iPhones and, especially, the new Google Pixels shake my confidence: the HTC U11 is my mobile of the entire year. The crimson U11, specifically. I‘ve been employing that machine for over per month nowadays, and having relied onto it to complete the rigors of the IFA tech exhibition in Berlin, I can confirm my initial thoughts about any of it. The U11 may be the phone with good things about it.

Here’s what the U11 gave me within my time in Germany, in ascending order worth focusing on: casually glorious looks that attracted compliments from strangers, rock-solid battery lifestyle that got me personally through long times of extreme work, and unsurpassed camcorder image quality.

And below you can get the original, which isn’t ideal on white balance because of the background screen, but retains every little detail, because of the steel buckles on the gent’s sneakers and the embossed detailing on the Oreo cookie.

Maybe I prioritize cellphone photography more than most, but considering that pictures will be the one lasting and genuinely unique thing you have gone after you’re done by using a cellphone, I consider them a hugely important differentiator. The HTC U11 surpasses actually the Google Pixel in this respect, not least as a result of its insanely good graphic stabilization that assures I get yourself a steady shot nearly every time.

As a reviewer of smartphones, my SIM card never stays in one device lengthy. The the other day has been especially tumultuous as I’ve switched between the U11, LG’s (pre-development) V30, the Google Pixel, and Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8. Commonly, I tend to progress through gadgets: The U11 got over from the Pixel, which got over from the iPhone 7, which supplanted the OnePlus 3, that was the device I moved to following the Take note 7 fiasco. Simply the Google Pixel and HTC U11 possess tempted me to look back in its history, and the latter phone may be the one I anticipate using for the near future.

Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Note 8 glimpse terrific and probably have the best screens available, but they’re pricey, possess the fingerprint sensor in a good whacky place, and so are a stage behind the U11 on imaging. LG’s V30 generates mind-blowing audio through its headphone jack, but unless it creates massive advancements in its last retail form, it as well lags behind the U11. And the iPhone? It’s not even in my top three cameraphones.

The U11’s practical advantages are clear: it includes clean, lightning-fast Android without silly extras that can’t be disabled; it’s waterproof; it lasts a full day no matter what you throw at it; and it has got typically well thought-out HTC ergonomics. Sure, I’d like that it had a headphone jack and shed those 2016 screen bezels, but there’s never been a mobile without compromises and the U11 isn’t breaking that tradition.

But what really makes me feel attached to this cellphone is its distinct appearance and exceptional pedigree. The iridescent aesthetic that HTC perfected with the Solar Crimson U11 can be an instant classic (in my eyes and those of my colleagues). You can aquire lost exploring the fluctuations between yellowish, orange, and crimson as you convert the telephone to reflect light differently - and even though you’re not paying attention to it, other people happen to be, commenting on its impressive and distinctive appearance.

You’ve probably heard about how exactly the Note 8 was a redeeming product for Samsung following the Note 7’s battery problems of this past year, but I start to see the U11 as an even bigger redemption story for HTC. This is the business that once defined the leading edge of Android phones, after that fell from grace due to some questionable design alternatives, and this year abruptly rediscovered its very best. Alas, HTC’s product sales continue to plummet, displaying the inertia of market that no longer trusts the Taiwanese company, but that just produces me root for the U11 even more. This is the best phone of the year, because it looks unique, because it works wonderful, and because it originates from a company which has no place for complacency.
